Quick Start:

1. install plugin into RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins
2. edit RMAPI.m and change the redmine url to your url and paste in your api key.  
        *NOTE* this is not the mail api key.  this is a redmine 0.9x feature only. you can get it in 'My Account'
3. Build and Go!

Unfortunately if you do not have a paid ADC iphone account you can not install this to your device, but once we make some more progress we will release it in the app store.

Todo list:

- make settings for username/password.  functionality that can download api-key and store it so that users don't have to type in api-key. (or something similar)
- finish revision viewing support. to be determined how yet.
- filter issues tab by project/assigned to me
- filter activities tab by project/assigned to me
- create new issue
- reply to issue
- migrate to official redmine 0.9x restful api when it makes more progress
