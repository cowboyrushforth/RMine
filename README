Quick Start:

1. install redmine plugin from folder Redmine_Plugin into RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins
2. restart your webserver
3. Open XCode Project, then Build and Go!

Unfortunately if you do not have a paid ADC iphone account you can not install this to your device, but once we make some more progress we will release it in the app store.

Todo list:

- catch bad authentication errors (if an api key is revoked persay) and send user back thru setup screen
- finish revision viewing support. to be determined how yet.
- filter issues tab by project/assigned to me
- filter activities tab by project/assigned to me
- create new issue
- reply to issue
- migrate to official redmine 0.9x restful api when it makes more progress
